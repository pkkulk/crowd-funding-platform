# Campaign Management Application

A React-based campaign management and donation platform featuring modern UI design, seamless routing, and responsive layouts.

## Overview

This project is a campaign management application built with React. It allows users to browse, view, and interact with various ongoing campaigns. The project has undergone a major UI and code modernization effort, including an upgrade to React Router v6 and a complete styling overhaul using Tailwind CSS.

## Features

- **Modern Routing:**  
  - Migrated from React Router v5 to v6 using `<Routes>`, `<Route>`, and `<Navigate>` for improved routing and navigation.
  
- **Responsive UI with Tailwind CSS:**  
  - Replaced Bootstrap classes and custom CSS modules with Tailwind CSS utility classes.
  - Ensured all components (Navbar, Footer, About Us, Contact Us, Campaign listings) are fully responsive across different devices.

- **Enhanced User Interface:**  
  - Redesigned components with a clean and modern aesthetic using Tailwind classes like `shadow-lg`, `rounded-lg`, and consistent spacing utilities.
  - Integrated smooth horizontal scrolling for campaign listings and improved typography for better readability.

- **Notifications & Loaders:**  
  - Integrated `react-toastify` for displaying toast notifications.
  - Implemented full-page loaders for better user feedback during asynchronous operations.

- **Modern Code Practices:**  
  - Utilized React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`, `useNavigate`) for state management and navigation.
  - Consolidated styling within components using Tailwind, reducing external dependencies and simplifying maintenance.
